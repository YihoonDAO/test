Registrars :

.dao is a set of smart contracts running on Ethereum Mainnet. Ordinary users cannot interact with smart contracts directly, but need to complete a series of operations such as registration and management of .dao through the user interface (Dapp UI).

A registrar, in the narrow sense, is a service provider that provides a registration interface for users. Its responsibilities include

developing the visual interface required for users to register .dao

If the user pays for the registration using a method other than HIW, then the registrar collects the user's fee and uses its own HIW to register the user's .dao account, earning a certain exchange rate difference.

A registrar, in the broader sense, does not only provide a registration interface for users, but also provides a range of related services. For example, secondary market trading, account expiration reminders, etc. Registrars can earn revenue by providing these services.

Registrars are an important player in the .dao ecosystem. Although the .dao development team currently provides a simple registration interface, it is our plan that all registration services will be provided by a good registrar. The .dao development team is focused on maintaining on-chain smart contracts. For any organization or individual who wants to become a registrar, you can contact us. We will provide complete technical support and guide users to use the registrar's services on our official website.
