# Promoters

The .dao team believes that those who drive the popularity of .dao should also be able to share the fruits of .dao's growth and development. Therefore, .dao has implemented an invitation rebate mechanism at the contract level.

If someone uses your invitation link when signing up for a .dao account, or fills in your .dao account as an inviter. Then, you will get a percentage of the other person's registration fee as an invitation bonus. Click to see the details of the bonus.

The invitation bonus is decentralized and is paid to the inviter as soon as the invitee completes the registration. In fact, the fees for registration/renewal/administration/reward settlement actions are all based on HIW within .dao. Therefore, promotion rewards are also issued in the form of HIW. The rewards can be viewed and withdrawn from the administration screen of the registration service.
