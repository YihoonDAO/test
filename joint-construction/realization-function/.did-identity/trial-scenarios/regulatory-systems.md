# Regulatory Systems

With blockchain technology, a regulatory flow network of factors of production is established, where each product or creation will have a unique DID account in the regulatory network, which is mapped to a single factor.

The regulator manages the dependencies between multiple elements through the issuance and holding of verifiable credentials.

This can be applied to the regulation of the circulation of goods, where each good has a verifiable credential from each chain of supervision, and the compliance of its origin and flow can be verified after circulation in the market.
