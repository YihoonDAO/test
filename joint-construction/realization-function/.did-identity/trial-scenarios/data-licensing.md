# Data Licensing

With the help of blockchain technology, a cross-platform personal private data authorization network will be established. Each user will have a unique DID account on a unified credit identity service platform and store the corresponding business data.

When a third party wishes to access this data, it will be authorized and verified through verifiable credentials.

It can be applied to the field of financial lending, for example, if an individual goes to a bank to borrow money and the latter needs some consumption data from the user, it can initiate an application for data viewing, and the user side will authorize and agree and issue consent credentials to access the relevant data and handle the corresponding business.

With the arrival of Web3.0, the ownership of data will return to the user, and the user must be authorized to use the data, and it is believed that there will be more and more relevant authorization scenarios.
