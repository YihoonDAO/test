# PMeta-universe identity

As the metaverse flourishes, each individual virtual reality will have a unique identity, and DID accounts are quite naturally suitable for this scenario. Users have a unique DID account identity in the metaverse, which can contain all kinds of real and valid credentials in real life and also all kinds of authorized credentials in the virtual world, and according to the actual needs, users can choose to display or use them to experience better services brought by the metaverse.

Different metaverse can have different DID account identities, and in the future, it can also realize account shuttle between different metaverse and "cross-universe" transaction of assets, etc.

The decentralized digital identity DID account system can be flexibly applied to C-side data authorization, B-side industry supervision and G-side public processing, and can avoid the embarrassing scenario of traditional blockchain accounts losing private keys and returning assets to zero.
