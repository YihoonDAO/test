# One Click Login

Dapp derived from the same chain, users do not need to register accounts repeatedly, and can realize unified account login by issuing the authorized login credentials of each application to the same DID account, eliminating the cumbersome account registration and management procedures and facilitating users' quick use. And based on this, the chain account assets can be managed in a unified manner, and the assets can be transferred between DID accounts at the cross-application level without the need to go through inter-application settlement, which is convenient for chain business construction and user use.

After the expansion, the DID accounts (different chains, different DID account system) can also be used for fast on-chain transactions between different public chains, without the need to associate transactions with each other through several respective application accounts, saving time and effort.
