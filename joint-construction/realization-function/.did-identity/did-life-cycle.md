# DID Life Cycle

dao provides users with autonomous and controllable, domain-wide self-discovery distributed digital identity, returning the control of user identity to users and breaking the information barrier between cross-platforms.

DID currently provides services in the form of domain name accounts, and its lifecycle management consists of the following.

Registering digital identity: Users generate key pairs, construct and initiate registration transactions according to the digital identity registration process, and upload DID documents to complete registration.

Freezing digital identity: Authorized management account constructs and initiates a freeze transaction to freeze DID digital identity.

Unfreeze digital identity: Authorize the management account to construct and initiate an unfreeze transaction to unfreeze the DID digital identity.

Change DID key: Authorize the administrative account to construct and initiate a key change transaction, upload a new public key, and complete the DID key change.

Change administrator account list: Authorize the managed account to build and initiate an administrator account list change transaction, upload the new administrator list, and complete the administrator account change.

Cancel digital identity: Authorize the administrative account to build and initiate a cancel transaction to perform DID digital identity cancellation.
