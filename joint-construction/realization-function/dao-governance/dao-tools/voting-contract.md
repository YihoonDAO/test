# Voting Contract

This is a smart contract that coordinates an on-chain pass-weighted vote on a proposal. The result of the vote must meet predefined conditions for DAO members or delegates (e.g., 66% of people voting to approve) and a quorum (e.g., 2% of pass holders participating) to be valid. The results get executed based on multiple signatures or proposals submitted as executable code, of which Compound's governance alpha voting contract is an example.
