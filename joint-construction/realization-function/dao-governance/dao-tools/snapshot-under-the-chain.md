# Snapshot under the chain

This is an off-chain platform that performs pass-weighted voting by signing off-chain messages and determines voting rights based on a snapshot of on-chain balances and addresses. The result of the vote can influence the subsequent development of the DAO. The benefit of this approach is that DAO members do not have to pay on-chain transaction fees when they vote, so they can incentivize more people in the community to participate in voting.
