# Multi-Sign Wallet

This is a smart contract that requires enough predefined addresses to sign a message in order to make changes to the protocol directly.DAOs typically use multi-signature techniques to initiate on-chain changes to the protocol based on off-chain snapshots of predefined committees, or as a security mechanism (e.g., to defend against governance attacks) in case of emergency.
