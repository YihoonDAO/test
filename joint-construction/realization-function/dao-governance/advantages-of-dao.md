# Advantages of DAO

The rules of a DAO (open source code) and the activities of DAO members (on-chain operations and forum postings) are usually public and can be viewed and audited by anyone, so that the decision-making process and the voting power distribution patterns of each member are fully known. This is in stark contrast to traditional organizations. Traditional organizations typically lack transparency, and users are forced to blindly trust that the organization will keep a complete and accurate record of the decision-making process and that the record will not be tampered with.

Democracy

Any member of the DAO can submit a proposal, challenge someone else's proposal, or vote on it. The DAO's decision-making mechanism is therefore more democratic, and members can collectively influence the direction of the DAO. This differs from a hierarchical traditional organization in which the CEO, owners, or board of directors have the privilege to unilaterally execute the majority of decisions, while other stakeholders have few avenues to voice their opinions.

Trust minimization

The DAO structure, consensus mechanism, and landed execution mechanism are written into the open source smart contract which is deployed on the public chain so that once consensus is reached, no party or small group can tamper with the governance process. This is not the case with traditional organizations. The governance process in traditional organizations is usually unfolded by a centralized entity, and the rules of the process are often complex and opaque, sometimes even based on private legal contracts, which are not only laborious to arbitrate, but also slow to enforce and difficult to guarantee certainty.

Inclusion

Anyone in the world who is connected to the Internet can participate in a DAO, and does not need to reveal full identifying information. This eliminates potential identity discrimination such as gender, race, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and nationality. This is also in stark contrast to traditional organizations. Members within traditional organizations are openly personally identified, making it difficult to create a purer system of excellence.

Weighing the Pros and Cons of DAOs

Rather than simply discussing the downsides of DAOs, a more meaningful approach would be to explore the trade-offs that need to be made between the different aspects of DAOs. These trade-offs are not right or wrong, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Each DAO needs to make judgments and trade-offs based on its own needs. Interestingly, almost all traditional governance structures face the same trade-offs, and the DAO is no exception.

Early Members vs. Later Members

DAOs may initially or eventually be controlled by a few giant whales, especially those that employ a pass-weighted voting mechanism. this is because the DAO's founders or early investors tend to get a higher percentage of the governance passes.

This not only leads to centralization issues, but also begs the more complex question of whether founders and early investors, who created the DAO and invested the most time and resources into its development, should therefore have the most voting power and influence? And if so, what percentage is reasonable? The dilemma to be addressed here is that the voices of community members who join later in the process may be drowned out by a minority of members, resulting in their participation contributing little value.

Essentially, the paradox here is how to reward and empower early participants for taking greater risks and providing more resources; but at the same time not restrict later joining members from moving up and having a voice. This is exactly the same as a traditional social system. It is important to incentivize early participants while maintaining some upward mobility.

Decentralization VS Efficiency

To maintain trust minimization, DAOs must establish checks and balances of power to avoid making irrational and unsupported community decisions too quickly. In addition, this will prevent DAOs from governance attacks and external infiltration attacks. Checks and balances are key mechanisms in modern democracies to avoid excessive concentration of power and to clearly define the responsibilities of each department.

The downside of decentralization, on the other hand, is inefficiency, resulting in DAOs not being able to execute their tasks on time. For example, they are unable to seize immediate profit opportunities or fix unexpected vulnerabilities quickly. The DAO's lack of agility and multi-layered decision-making mechanisms consume a lot of time and resources, making it difficult to compete with hierarchically centralized organizations, especially in the ever-changing field of open source technologies.

The paradox here is how to maintain the core value of trust minimization - which is invaluable to DAOs - while at the same time improving decision efficiency and eliminating lengthy decision processes. This leads to the larger question of whether protocols can transition from a traditional centralized governance architecture to a more decentralized DAO architecture. If the answer is yes, how long will it take to complete the transition? What factors need to be focused on in the process? In fact, governments face the same challenge of protecting basic human rights and laws while being flexible enough to hold onto the fruits of growth and quickly repel emerging threats.

Stability vs. growth

When it comes to decentralized trust-minimizing technologies, the first thing that comes to some people's minds is that "no governance is the best governance". This is because there are indeed few fair, secure and stable governance systems in human history, and therefore any governance model breeds corruption from within and without. There is indeed some truth to this statement, but the truth is that almost all social institutions are inherently dynamic and therefore iterate to meet the needs of their members.

The challenge for DAOs is to balance the paradox of focusing on solidifying the underlying rules of the protocol and simultaneously phasing out the DAO function, with the paradox of continuously evolving the protocol and maintaining flexibility, which often requires extending the application scenarios of the DAO. This is the dilemma facing many DAOs today, with DAO members locked in endless internal debates as they disagree on the ultimate vision for the DAO. Often the arguments fall into two camps, one that wants to strictly follow the original vision of the protocol, and the other that wants to extend the original application scenario of the protocol to cover a larger market.

The paradox here is the need to have both a clear vision as the basis for DAO development and a flexible architecture that can be continuously improved to meet new needs of DAO members. This problem has actually been very common throughout human history. As demographics and historical contexts change, people may have very different perspectives on a common vision for society or the direction of future development.

Leaderless vs. led

Many people believe that DAOs should be leaderless, which may be related to the idea promoted by decentralization. Societies without leaders may work in some cases, but throughout history, societies that lack strong leadership tend to operate less efficiently than those with clear leaders. A society without leaders can suffer from the "tragedy of the commons". This phenomenon refers to the neglect of the common good because no one steps forward to assume management responsibilities. Such a society also has a power vacuum, and the absence of a leader can lead to conflict among internal factions to fill the power vacuum. In addition to this, such a society lacks the vision and determination to truly realize a complex vision, and therefore ends up in stagnation.

And the downside of having leaders is that once they have too much power, they have the potential to do evil, which would offset the biggest advantage of decentralized autonomous organizations. As a result, some DAOs are already exploring representation. Synthetix, for example, has created The Spartan Council, a seven-member group elected by DAOs to make decisions on user-submitted improvement proposals. synthetix grabs snapshots of off-chain votes, submits them to the Spartan Council, and in this way tries out the Synthetix pass holder community before voting on attitude of the proposal.

The paradox here is to provide enough incentives and autonomy to attract, empower, and protect good visionary leaders; but also to limit the unbridled expansion of their power so that they do not behave in a way that deviates from the DAO consensus. It's an interesting balance because good government leaders have built the best societies in human history, and bad government leaders have created the most disastrous societies in human history.

Short term vs. long term

Another major challenge facing DAOs is how to balance the needs and concerns of DAO members. For example, some DAO members are most concerned with short-term growth, such as how to capture more value or attract more lobbying capital, even at the expense of long-term flexibility in the DAO vault. Other DAO members are more concerned with actually driving adoption and achieving sustainability in the long term, goals that often do not benefit DAO members in the short to medium term.

This paradox is intertwined with the "leadership vs. no leadership" and "early vs. late members" paradoxes mentioned above. Therefore, they may have already made a lot of money in the early stage, and their own interests (financial and reputation) are more at stake in the sustainability of the DAO, so they will naturally be more concerned about the long-term development of the DAO. New members are usually not deeply involved in the interests of the DAO, so they will be more concerned about short-term interests, and if their wishes are not met after a while, they may leave.

The paradox here is that it is necessary to deal with the concerns of different DAO members rationally, not all needs can be met at the same time, and adhere to long-term planning for eventual success; but also to accommodate the reasonable concerns of DAO members. Traditional governance mechanisms often face the same paradox when introducing major policy changes. On the one hand, they need to accept that some citizens may be dissatisfied with the policy shift; but on the other hand, if they cannot get enough support or if the policy cannot achieve tangible results on the ground, then the policy change will not gain enough momentum to be truly implemented and have an impact.

Professionals VS Non-Professionals

Blockchain technology is the core value proposition of DAO. However, only a few people can fully understand the underlying smart contracts of DAOs and the blockchain they are on. In addition, there are various legal and business factors to consider in order to make rational judgments against DAO proposals, such as investing in new businesses. This requires DAO members with expertise - usually developers, lawyers, experts in various fields, and founders - to specifically parse the proposal before the DAO vote.

The challenge here is that most DAO members cannot properly weigh the pros and cons without the help of these experienced members. For example, DAOs need experienced members to explain complex technical terms and to specifically analyze legal and economic areas. Because these members are so important, the question becomes: Should they be given more weight in the voting? Or should the DAO at least reward these members?

The paradox here is that DAOs need to both incentivize experienced members to maintain activity and contributions; and not over-rely or over-empower these members in a way that discourages other members from participating. Governments can face the same problem. Governments need to both rely on expert help in some cases, and not ignore the differing opinions of other citizens or experts in the process.

No Stake VS Superfinancialization

All DAOs must set appropriate barriers to entry or be vulnerable to witch hunts, and even people with no history or financial pledges in the DAO can manipulate the outcome of decisions. Most DAOs set certain participation thresholds, such as having to hold a DAO's native governance pass.

The problem here is that someone may hold a high share of governance passes, or even temporarily borrow them, to influence the outcome of governance votes and launch so-called "governance attacks" on the DAO. The paradox here is that DAOs need to set certain barriers to entry in order to defend themselves against witch attacks, but they cannot build an organizational structure based entirely on financial capital. If DAOs do not set non-financial barriers to entry, they are likely to face the problem of super-financialization, i.e. all decisions are directly linked to financial power. Vitalik's paper "Decentralized Society: Finding the Web's Soul" proposes the creation of soul-bound passwords. In his paper "Decentralized Society: Finding the Web's Soul", Vitalik proposes creating soul-bound passes that reward on-chain users in a non-financial way.

The paradox here is to ensure that DAO members pledge assets or reputation in some form, while avoiding the problem of super-financialization of DAOs. Today's society faces the same problem, with financial capital having too much influence in collective decision-making. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
