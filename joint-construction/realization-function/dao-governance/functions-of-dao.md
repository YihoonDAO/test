# Functions of DAO

The DAO can perform any function, the most common ones are as followsï¼š

Approve upgrades to open source protocols - such as voting on whether to upgrade the protocol's proxy smart contracts to support additional code logic; or additionally releasing a new version of the protocol and migrating users over.

Tweak dApp parameters - such as adjusting the interest rate on decentralized stablecoin, or deciding whether to add new collateral assets to the lending market.

Submit proposals for improvements and discuss them - such as formally launching a proposal to change the specifics of the protocol/DAO, or challenging other proposals before a formal vote.

Use funds controlled by the agreement for investment or transfer to an external account - such as sending prizes from the DAO vault to winners, or deciding whether the DAO will invest in a limited edition NFT.

Managing leadership - for example, by voting on the retention of managers, vetoing leadership decisions, or changing the DAO's organizational structure.

Arbitrate disagreements over the use of the protocol, dApp, or DAO infrastructure-for example, by deciding whether to compensate users for damages suffered by accidental attacks or protocol vulnerabilities.

Decide on the long-term roadmap and ultimate vision for the protocol - such as discussing whether the DAO should scale on top of existing vertical application scenarios, or deciding which blockchains or Layer 2 networks the DAO should be integrated into.

Develop a value capture mechanism for the protocol - such as the percentage of user fees to be contributed, whether to destroy passes, or whether DAO members should receive a dividend.
