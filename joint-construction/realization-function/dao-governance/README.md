# DAO Governance

DAO does not refer exclusively to an industry or a field, it is an organizational governance structure, just like an LLC can engage in various businesses, DAO can do both asset management and DeFi protocols, NFT

Any organization is inseparable from decision-making, and how to make decisions depends on the governance model. As the most common organization, the current governance structure is management + board: management oversees the day-to-day operations of the company, while the board provides strategic oversight and reviews management. Corporate governance is primarily about the right to claim and control the residual value of the company, such as whether net profits are used for shareholders' dividends or for reproduction. The goal of governance is to increase the value of the company and maximize the interests of shareholders.

Corporate governance and companies have evolved over the centuries, but the current dominant governance model is not best practice and does not fit all corporate organizations. For example, individual shareholders, limited by financial resources, generally have a small share in the company and do not have sufficient motivation or strength to monitor entrepreneurs, but are willing to become passive shareholders. Another example is that Internet platforms use content or data produced by creators to obtain advertising revenue, which, under traditional corporate governance structures, goes to shareholders and lacks reasonable incentives for creators. There are also problems such as non-transparent governance process, misaligned incentives and inefficient governance.

The earliest and most expected application scenario for the automatic execution of smart contracts provided by the Ethernet mainline, which went online in 2016, is governance. This type of organization that collaborates by enforcing a set of rules on the blockchain is called a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). At the time, expectations were so high that the decentralized venture capital fund The DAO raised $150 million in a short period of time.The DAO replaced shareholders with token holders, allowing the largest token holder to actually serve as the board of directors for the agreement. This de facto board helps steer the direction of the agreement by proposing or voting for upgrades and guiding future developments.
