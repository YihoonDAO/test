# .dao alias

dao Alias is a feature introduced by .dao that allows you to give a globally unique alias (Alias) to any address you own.

For example, you can give your BTC address bc123...456 an alias to mybtc.dao. .456 as mybtc.dao so that when other developers want to show bc123.... .456 to the user, you can show the alias mybtc.dao, so that other users can verify the owner of the address.

For more information, see the .dao website and article:

[.dao Alias official website.](../../register-.dao/character-list/fraud-prevention.md)
