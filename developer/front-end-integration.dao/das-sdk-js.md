# das-sdk-js

[das-sdk-js](../../overview/faq/registration-related/can-i-register-a-sub-account.md) is an npm package that encapsulates the JSON-RPC calls to the indexer.

The Dapp simply integrates the SDK and calls the corresponding interface (data by .dao [das-account-indexer](../../overview/faq/registration-related/can-i-register-a-sub-account.md)) to get the required data.

Note that after the application gets the value of the data set by the user, it has to check the validity of the value
