# Dependency

To use this SDK, you need to rely on the JSON-RPC service provided by [das-account-indexer](../../overview/faq/registration-related/can-i-register-a-sub-account.md).

We recommend that developers build their own .dao Indexer, but developers can use the official .dao Indexer service for development and testing during the development phase, see.
