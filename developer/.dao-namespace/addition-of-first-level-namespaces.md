# Addition of first-level namespaces

dao currently provides only four first-level namespaces: address, profile, dweb, and custom\_key, but this is not the final result. The .dao team will gradually add more namespaces as they become available. In the meantime, we need valid suggestions from the community of developers. If you think some namespaces should be added to allow better collaboration between applications. You can raise issues with us in Github.
