# .dao namespace

dao is the core of .dao, and the power of .dao extends from the flexibility of parsing records. A parsed record is a key-value key-value pair, and .dao supports an infinite number of parsed records. As shown above, different applications will read different parse records to do different jobs. Therefore, the namespace management of the key of the parsed record is particularly important. The namespace usage specification is essentially a protocol that can be followed to enable good collaboration between applications.
