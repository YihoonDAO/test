The preparation work required to develop different types of applications varies.

If the .dao account is to be a practical NFT asset, develop a trading/auction/rental marketplace for .dao. You need to understand.

The fundamentals of **Ethereum**, its data structure and transaction structure ([learn Ethereum](../../overview/faq/inviters-registrar-channel-related/))

The fundamentals of .dao, its data structure and transaction structure ([learn .dao](../../overview/faq/registration-related/can-i-register-a-sub-account.md))

To develop applications based on the parsed records of .dao accounts, you do not need to know the technical details of Nervos CKB and .dao. You only need to know how to use[ das-account-indexer](../../joint-construction/participate-in-the-construction-of-.dao.md) or [das-sdk-js](../.dao-alias/parse.dao-alias/back-end-analysis.md) to get the resolved records of an account, or to query whether an address holds a .dao account. As well as understanding the namespace specification for resolving records for .dao.
