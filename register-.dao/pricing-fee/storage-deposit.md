# Storage Deposit

The storage fee corresponds to the amount of on-chain storage space required to store account information on the chain. dao is carefully structured so that a fixed storage fee is pledged for each .dao account, regardless of the number of parsed records in the account. If an account expires and is not renewed, the storage deposit will be returned to the account's Owner address, whichever it was at the time of expiration.

Since .dao is a decentralized application running on both Ethereum Mainnet Binance Smart Chain Mainnet Polygon Mainnet, it only recognizes HIW as a payment method for fees. Therefore, the .dao team maintains a HIW/USD price prediction machine service that allows the contract to know how much HIW should be charged when a user registers, while the presence of a .DAO registrar allows users to pay in any currency.
