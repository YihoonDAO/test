# Registration Rules

As a public resource, .dao accounts should avoid being hoarded by a few when they do not have enough social influence. The .dao account registration should be opened gradually.

| Account Character Length | Open Registration Rules    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 10 and above             | All open registration      |
| 4-9 positions            | See note below for details |
| 1-3 positions            | To be determined           |

Release Plan 2023-01-01

In view of the intersection between Vietnamese character set, Turkish character set and English character set, to avoid potential problems caused by liberalization, we keep the release ratio of Vietnamese and Turkish the same as English.

So far, the release ratio of pure Vietnamese, pure Turkish, and pure English character sets are all 60%.

The release status of other character sets is consistent with the 2022-10-18 release schedule.

Release schedule 2023-03-03

dao has already been integrated with mainstream wallets and Dapps, .dao has reached a new level of unique addresses and is ecologically active enough, and .dao's pioneering NameDAO has successfully expanded .dao's reach and community size.

Therefore, we plan to start a new account release on October 18 at 12:00 PM (UTC+0) to continue the development of NameDAO.

Release Details

All plain numeric .dao, plain Emoji .dao, plain Thai .dao, plain Korean .dao, plain Turkish .dao, and plain Vietnamese .dao with 4 or more digits in length can be registered.

Release Plan 2023-06-06

For reasons of fairness, only 35% of .bit accounts are currently available for random registration. As .bit integrates with more DApps and .bit brand awareness grows, we think it's time to release more accounts.

As we upgrade our brand, we are announcing our release schedule.
