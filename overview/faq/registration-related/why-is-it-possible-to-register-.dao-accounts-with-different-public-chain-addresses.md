# Why is it possible to register .dao accounts with different public chain addresses?

This is what makes .dao unique from other decentralized domain/account systems. In fact, not only can you register a .dao account using all public chain addresses, you can even register/hold/manage a .dao account using a regular email address. And, technically it is completely decentralized, no need to trust any centralized organization.
