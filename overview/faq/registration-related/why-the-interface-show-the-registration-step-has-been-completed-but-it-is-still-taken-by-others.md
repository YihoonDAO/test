The only possibility for this situation is that someone else and you both happen to want to register the account and both did it at about the same time. Anti-squatting can only prevent malicious squatting after someone gets the account you want to register by watching the blockchain. But it can't prevent all parties from spontaneously registering an account at exactly the same time.
