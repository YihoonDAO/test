# What public chain addresses can I use to register a .dao account?

Registration of .dao accounts with ETH / BSC / Polygon addresses is currently supported. Visit the .dao link MetaMask to start registration. You can also register directly by accessing .dao in ETH / BSC / Polygon enabled wallet APPs.\
\
Technically, .dao can be registered using any public chain address (see the link for the principle). The .dao team is in the process of deploying more public chain signature algorithms to other networks to support registration of .dao with more public chain addresses.\
