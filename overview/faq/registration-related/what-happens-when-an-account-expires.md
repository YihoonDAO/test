# What happens when an account expires?

If the 90-day protection period has expired, the account will be withdrawn directly.\
\
After the expiration time of the .dao account, it will enter a 90-day protection period. If you renew your .dao account during the protection period, you will still have the .dao account. If the .dao account is not renewed within the protection period, the .dao account will be put up for auction for 28 days at a reduced price and the first bidder will get the account. At the end of the auction period, if no bids are received, the account will become publicly available for registration at a price determined by the number of characters in the account.\
