description: Is the administration of .dao centralized?

# Why do I only need to sign to manage my account and not to pay network fees?

The administration of .dao is decentralized. The reason for not having to pay network fees is that the user has already pre-populated the storage of the .dao account with network fees at the time of registration, and these fees are sufficient to perform tens of thousands of administrative operations on your .dao account.
