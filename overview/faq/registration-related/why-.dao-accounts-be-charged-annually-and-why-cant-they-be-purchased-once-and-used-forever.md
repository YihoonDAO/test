# Why .dao accounts be charged annually, and why can't they be purchased once and used forever?

A one-time purchase for permanent use is not a sound economic model. Problems with this model include the following:\
\
1、Once all the quality accounts are purchased, the .dao system will no longer generate revenue and the existing development team will lack the incentive to continuously improve the system and attract new developers to maintain .dao. However, as an infrastructure, continuous improvement and promotion of .dao will be inevitable. Therefore, it may seem attractive to buy once and use forever, but the user is actually buying an account that will not be maintained in the future.\
\
2、Loss of private keys, etc. can lead to permanent locking of .dao accounts. This is a waste of a limited public resource like .dao accounts.\
\
In fact, you can also renew your .dao account for decades at a time for "perpetual use".\
