# What is a storage deposit ?

Each .dao account's data is stored on the blockchain, and storing the data requires storage space, which requires pledged tokens to be used. When the account expires and is recycled, the corresponding storage space is released and the pledged tokens are returned to the account owner at that time.\
\
At the same time, .dao is designed in such a way that a one-time storage deposit is paid at the time of registration, and no additional deposit is required no matter how many parsed records are added during use.\
\
The other storage deposit will be refunded in the form of tokens issued in the future.\
