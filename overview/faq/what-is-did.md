# What is DID?

DID is a decentralized identity authentication technology platform.

A decentralized identity authentication technology platform refers to a system that allows individuals to have control over their personal data and enables secure authentication and verification processes without relying on a central authority. This type of platform utilizes blockchain technology to create a decentralized and secure network where users can store, manage, and share their personal information, such as identity documents, in a secure and encrypted manner.

The decentralized nature of these platforms ensures that users have full control over their data and reduces the risk of data breaches, hacking, and unauthorized access. Additionally, because there is no central authority managing the system, there is no need to trust a third-party organization with sensitive personal information.
