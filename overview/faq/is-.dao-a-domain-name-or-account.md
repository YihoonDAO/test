# Is .dao a domain name or account?

.dao is an account, not a domain name. We always need a fixed suffix to identify something, such as a file suffix to identify the type of file, a mailbox suffix to identify where the mailbox is, and a domain suffix to identify what the domain is. So although the unified .dao suffix makes .dao look like a top-level domain, it is only used to identify .dao accounts.
