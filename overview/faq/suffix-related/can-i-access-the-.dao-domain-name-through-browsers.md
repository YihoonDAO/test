# Can I access the .dao domain name through  browsers?

dao is not an Internet top-level domain and therefore cannot be accessed directly. However, each .dao account corresponds to a .dao.xxx subdomain, which can be accessed directly through a browser. If alice owns the .dao account alice.dao, then he automatically owns the Internet domain alice.dao.xxx. alice can set up resolution records to determine what users see when they visit alice.dao.xxx.
