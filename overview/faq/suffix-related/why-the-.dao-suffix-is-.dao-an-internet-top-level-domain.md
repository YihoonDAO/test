# Why the .dao suffix, is .dao an Internet top-level domain?

.dao is not an Internet top-level domain and therefore does not conflict with the ICANN-accredited Internet domain namespace. The reason for using .dao as a suffix is that:\


1. .dao is the basic unit of information, the world of the future is the world of information, dao is the basic building block of the information world, in line with the vision of .dao trying to become the infrastructure.
2. .dao is neutral, not associated with any chain, in line with the cross-chain nature of .dao.
3. .dao is a shorthand for dao organization, which is a representative of the spirit of autonomy.
4. .dao is fair.\
