# Will .dao have other suffixes in the future?

We believe that .dao should have no other suffixes for the following reasons.

1. More suffixes do not bring benefits to users, but make usage more cumbersome
2. More suffixes are a form of namespace pollution, both for the blockchain domain name system and for the Internet domain name system. As a Web 3.0 infrastructure, .dao deserves to be restrained.
