# Why are inviter/channel rewards settled in .dao token(to be named)?

This is due to the fact that .DAO is a smart contract running on, which internally can only recognize main net assets.

In fact, registration/renewal/administration/reward settlement fees for these actions are used internally by .dao as the basis for the token. The reason why registration fees can be paid in other currencies is that the registrar provides the appropriate service.
